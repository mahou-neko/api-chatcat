def makeWebhookResultLayerAbout(layer):
    layerdef = {'physical layer':'The physical layer handels mechanical and electrical/optical linkage. It converts logical symbols into electrical(optical) ones and measures optical signals to reconstruct logical symbols', 
    'data link layer':'The data link layer covers transmission errors and handels media access. It is also concerned with congestion control.', 
    'network layer':'On the network layer paths from senders to recipients are chosen. Hence this layer also has to cope with heterogenius subnets and is responsibe for accounting.',
    'transport layer':'The transport layer offers secure end-to-end-communication between processes. Therefore it is also in charge for data stream control between endsystems. A few concerns of this layer are multiplexing, segmentation and acknowledgements in order to provide reliable transmission.',
    'session layer':'The name of this layer almost gives all its functionalities away! It mostly deals with communication managment, dialog control and synchronization.',
    'presentation layer':'Converting between dataformats, compression and decrompession as well as encryption are the main converns of the presentation layer.',
    'application layer':'Its name almost tells it all. The application layer handels communication between applications and deals with application specific services like e-mail, telnet etc.',
    'layer':'Alright! Layers basically are subdivisions of communication models. A Layer basically is a collection of similar functions that provide services to the layer above it and receives services from the layer below it.',
    'internet':'The internet layer has the same responsabilites as the third layer of the OSI model (which would be the network layer).',
    'link':'The link layer corresponds to the OSI model layers 1 and 2 (physical layer and data link layer).'}
